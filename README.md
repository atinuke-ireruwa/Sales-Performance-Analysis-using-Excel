- Introduce product bundling by pairing high-margin products with slower-moving items to boost overall sales and improve the performance of
underperforming stock.

- Implement cross-selling and upselling techniques by promoting complementary products within high-demand categories, thereby increasing the average
transaction value per customer.

- Collectively, these strategies are designed to drive sales growth through targeted product optimization, strategic pricing, and enhanced customer
engagement in the coming years.
