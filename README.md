Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, incorrect data types).

Standardized formats (e.g., date, currency).

Created calculated fields to support analysis (e.g., profit margin, shipping delay).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed overall sales and profit distributions.

Identified top-performing and underperforming product categories.

# Visual Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales & profit performance over a four-year period, from 2014 to 2017. It incorporates interactive
slicers that allow users to filter and view performance data for a specific year, enabling focused analysis and comparison of sales & profit trends
across different time frames.

# Recommendations

Refine the pricing strategy by analyzing annual sales trends and average product performance to adjust prices for both top-selling and
underperforming items. This approach aims to set competitive price points that maximize profitability while maintaining sales volume.

Introduce product bundling by pairing high-margin products with slower-moving items to boost overall sales and improve the performance of
underperforming stock.

Implement cross-selling and upselling techniques by promoting complementary products within high-demand categories, thereby increasing the average
transaction value per customer.

Collectively, these strategies are designed to drive sales growth through targeted product optimization, strategic pricing, and enhanced customer
engagement in the coming years.
